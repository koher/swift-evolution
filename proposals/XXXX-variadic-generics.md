Variadic Generics is a feature listed in the [Generics Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md)
document as one of the major features that needs to be implemented to "complete"
generics. It's also a feature that has lately come up in various threads on the
[Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org), like for example (in no particular
order) in [[1]](https://forums.swift.org/t/emulating-variadic-generics-in-swift/20046),
[[2]](https://forums.swift.org/t/map-sorting/21421/12), [[3]](https://forums.swift.org/t/variadic-generics/20320),
[[4]](https://forums.swift.org/t/implementing-expressiblebytupleliteral-how-hard/21169).

This document is kind of a follow up to a [previos one](https://github.com/austinzheng/swift-evolution/blob/az-variadic-generics/proposals/XXXX-variadic-generics.md)
by [Austin Zheng](https://forums.swift.org/u/Austin) - "kind of" because I've
read the document, but not too in depth. This was intentional: I've never worked
too much with variadic generics in my programming life and I wanted to start
"fresh" and as unbiased as possible on the topic, to see if I could come up with
new or interesting ideas.
Obviously the information contained in the mentioned document and collected on
the Swift Forums are going to influence what's presented there.

## Motivation
<!---    1         2         3         4         5         6         7      --->
<!---67890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456--->

Let's take a look at some ways Variadic Generics can improve Swift.

### Example 1: zip
<!---    1         2         3         4         5         6         7      --->
<!---67890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456--->

Currently Swift has a `zip` free function that takes in any two `Sequence`s and
return a new `Sequence` containing pairs of elements from the original ones:
```swift
func zip<Sequence1: Sequence, Sequence2: Sequence>(
  _ sequence1: Sequence1, _ sequence2: Sequence2
) -> Zip2Sequence<Sequence1, Sequence2> {
  return Zip2Sequence(sequence1, sequence2)
}
 ```
The problem here is that this function can only zip two sequences, and has to
return a specific type `Zip2Sequence` that holds said two sequences. If one
needs to zip three sequences he has to create a `Zip3Sequence` and overload
`zip`, and this leads to a lot of code duplication:
```swift
struct Zip3Sequence<Sequence1: Sequence, Sequence2: Sequence, Sequence3: Sequence> {
  [...]
}

extension Zip3Sequence {
  struct Iterator {
    [...]
  }
}

func zip<Sequence1: Sequence, Sequence2: Sequence, Sequence3: Sequence>(
  _ sequence1: Sequence1, _ sequence2: Sequence2, _ sequence3: Sequence3
) -> Zip3Sequence<Sequence1, Sequence2, Sequence3> {
  return Zip3Sequence(sequence1, sequence2, sequence3)
}
```
With Variadic Generics only a `ZipSequence<AnyNumOfSequences>` and a single
`zip` function would need to exist.

### Example 2: combineLatest
<!---    1         2         3         4         5         6         7      --->
<!---67890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456--->

[Reactive programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)
libraries have a function `combineLatest` or something similar that takes
various streams of data (`Observable`s, `Signal`s, etc) and combine their latest
outputs in a single value, eventually transformed by a closure:
```swift
// Here I'm using `ObservableType` as a protocol for data stream types, and
// `Observable` as a concrete type implementing `ObservableType`

protocol ObservableType {
  /// The type of the element that this data stream outputs
  associatedtype E
}

class Observable<E> {
  /// Merge two streams together into one single stream by using the specified
  /// function any time one of the input streams produces an element.
  func combineLatest<O1: ObservableType, O2: ObservableType>(
    _ o1: O1, _ o2: O2, transformation: (O1.E, O2.E) -> E
  ) -> Observable<E> {
    return CombineLatest2([...])
  }

  /// Merge three streams together into one single stream by using the specified
  /// function any time one of the input streams produces an element.
  func combineLatest<O1: Observable, O2: Observable, O3: Observable>(
    _ o1: O1, _ o2: O2, _ o3: O3, transformation: (O1.E, O2.E, O3.E) -> E
  ) -> Observable<E> {
    return CombineLatest3([...])
  }

  // and so on up to some arity
  [...]  
}
```
Again, here we have some code duplication that might be avoided with Variadic
Generics. This example is similar to the `zip` one, but here we have a
difference: the function definition contains a *closure whose shape depends on
the number of previous parameters*.
This indicates that we need to be able to retrieve the actual number of
concerete types that are passed to a Variadic Generic in its instantiation.

### Example 3: variadic sorting
<!---    1         2         3         4         5         6         7      --->
<!---67890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456--->

[Reference](https://forums.swift.org/t/emulating-variadic-generics-in-swift/20046).
Let's imagine we have the following `Animal` struct and an `Array` of said
animals:
```
struct Animal {
  let name: String
  let age: Int
  let weight: Double
}

var someAnimals: [Animal] = giveMeAnArrayOfAnimals()
```
What if we want to sort this array by multiple properties? We might like to do
the following:
```
someAnimals.sort(\.name, \.age, \.weight)
```
But if we try to declare the function we got this error:
```
extension Array {
  func sort<T: Comparable>(_ sortProperties: KeyPath<Element, T>...) {
    [...]
  }
}

someAnimals.sort(\.name, \.age, \.weight)
// error: type of expression is ambiguous without more context
// someAnimals.sort(\.name, \.age, \.weight)
//                  ^~~~~~
```
I'm not actually sure if this example is different from the `zip` one. I feel
there is some difference because in this case Variadic Generics are not used
"directly" in the function signature, but instead to construct another type that
depends on them i.e. `KeyPath<Element, T>`.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe
how they work. Show how your solution is better than current
workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new
syntax in the language, show the additions and changes to the Swift
grammar. If it's a new API, show the full API and its documentation
comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be
sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to
reasonably implement the feature.

## Impact on existing code

Describe the impact that this change will have on existing code. Will some
Swift applications stop compiling due to this change? Will applications still
compile but produce different behavior than they used to? Is it
possible to migrate existing Swift code to use a new feature or API
automatically?

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and
why you chose this approach instead.
